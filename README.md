# Circle of Fifths (music theory)

<!-- ![alt tag](screen.png) -->

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Next.js

Explore fundamental music theory with the Circle of Fifths (CoF).

## Optimizations

This project is scoped to front end. Next.js provides great boilerplate and development features built-in.

## Lessons Learned:

The CoF concept has proven illusive in my music journey. Music comes down to math (always?) and when authoring MusicMatters.life, I was skirting around the harshness that CoF aims to quell.

## TODOs:

- The Circle of Fifths
  - Key signatures
  - Sharp / Flat denotation
  - Major / Minor relationships
